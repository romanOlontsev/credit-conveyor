### Stack

- Java 
- SpringBoot
- PostgreSQL 
- JPA 
- Swagger 
- Kafka 
- JUnit
- Mockito
- TestContainers

### Requirements

The application can be run locally, the requirements for setup are listed below.

#### Local

- [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.9.3/apache-maven-3.9.3-bin.zip)

#### Docker

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)

#### Properties

1. Application will run by default on port `8081`.
   Configure the port by changing `server.port` in `application.properties`.

2. This MS calls the **Conveyor MS** endpoints.
   By default, base URL is `conveyor.client.base-url=http://localhost:8082/conveyor`.

3. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) is used as db by default.
    - [Schema](https://github.com/romanOlontsev/credit-conveyor/blob/develop/migrations/credit-app-schema.sql)
    - Properties:
        - `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:8032/credit_app_db`
        - `spring.datasource.username=root`
        - `spring.datasource.password=root`
4. Kafka bootstrap servers by default on port `29092`.

### Quick Start

#### Run Docker

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.projectup.yml up
```

Application will run by default on port `8080`

Configure the port by changing services.api.ports in **docker-compose.projectup.yml**. 
Port 8080 was used by default so the value is easy to identify and change in the configuration file.

### API

Interaction with the project occurs in the **Gateway MS**. 
The list of endpoints can be viewed via the link: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui)
